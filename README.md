## Introduction

The SecureAI cybersecurity software is designed to address the security needs of organizations by incorporating various security measures, including password hashing, encryption, network scanning, intrusion detection, and more. It aims to provide robust protection against common cyber threats and enhance overall cybersecurity posture.

## Features

### Password Hashing with Bcrypt

The software utilizes the Bcrypt library to securely hash passwords with salts. This ensures that user passwords are stored securely and protected against unauthorized access.

### Symmetric Encryption using AES-GCM

The software supports symmetric encryption using the AES-GCM algorithm. It provides functions to encrypt and decrypt messages, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data.

### Asymmetric Encryption using RSA

Asymmetric encryption using the RSA algorithm is supported by the software. It enables secure communication between parties by using public and private key pairs to encrypt and decrypt messages.

### Basic Network Scanning with Nmap

The software includes basic network scanning capabilities using the Nmap library. It allows users to scan hosts and identify open ports and potential vulnerabilities in the network.

### Simple Intrusion Detection with Scapy

Intrusion detection functionality is provided by the software using the Scapy library. It detects suspicious network traffic and alerts users of possible intrusion attempts.

### Data Anonymization and Pseudonymization

To comply with privacy laws and regulations, the software incorporates data anonymization and pseudonymization techniques. This helps protect the privacy of individuals and ensures compliance with data protection requirements.

### Data Portability

The software includes a data portability feature that allows users to export their data in a portable format. This enables easy transfer and migration of data between different systems or platforms.
